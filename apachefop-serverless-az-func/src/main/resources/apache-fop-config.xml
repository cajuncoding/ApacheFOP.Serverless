                     NOTE: On Windows there are alot of fonts available so the VERY FIRST startup time will be impacted signficantly
                            (seconds, or even a couple minutes) until a local cache file is built.  Once the cache file is built for a server
                            though startup times will be normal.
                     NOTE: In Serverless environments this can be exasperated though because each
                            new Serverless spun up will not have a cache file by default!
